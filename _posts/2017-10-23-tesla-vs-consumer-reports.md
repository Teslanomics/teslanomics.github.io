##// Tesla vs Consumer Reports Round 5

Timeline of Events
 - ’99 CR gives RWD Tesla Model S a 99/100 - the highest score ever - [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/07/tesla-model-s-review/index.htm)

- Aug ’15 CR tests AWD P85D score 103/100 Breaking the Scale
- CR from this Test [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/tesla-model-s-p85d-earns-top-road-test-score)

"In rating it, however, we faced a quandary: The Tesla initially scored 103 in the Consumer Reports' Ratings system, which by definition doesn’t go past 100. The car set a new benchmark, so we had to make changes to our scoring to account for it. Those changes didn’t affect the scores of other cars. ...

To be clear, the Tesla’s 100 score doesn’t make the P85D a perfect car—even at $127,820. It has imperfections. The interior materials aren’t as opulent as other high-ticket automobiles, and its ride is firmer and louder than our base Model S.

It’s also important to note that our Rating doesn’t include the Tesla’s reliability. The Model S has average reliability, according to our owner-survey responses.”

They finished by saying

"That said, the Tesla Model S P85D is an automotive milepost. It’s a remarkable car that paves a new, unorthodox course, and it’s a powerful statement of American startup ingenuity.”


- Later in Oct 2015 they published another article titled "Tesla Reliability Doesn’t Match Its High Performance” - [link](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars-tesla-reliability-doesnt-match-its-high-performance/)

- This is when things started to turn sour…

- CR dinged Tesla again for not having an emergency braking feature
- Tesla added this AEB with an update but CR said it was only a partial fix
- Eventually the Model S regained it’s top ranking for an ultra-luxury sedan

And  just last week Consumer Reports published their ranking for the upcoming Tesla Model 3. Here are some bits from the report (link)

"Tesla Model S owners reported their car’s reliability has improved in Consumer Reports' latest survey, giving the EV sedan its first above-average rating.

Because of the Model S’s improved rating, the all-new Tesla Model 3 EV predicted reliability rating also has improved, rising to average in CR's rankings. That's because Tesla’s less expensive Model 3 borrows much of its technology from its bigger brother.

Consumer Reports doesn't have data yet specifically from Model 3 owners, but it makes predictions on every new and redesigned vehicle based on the manufacturer's history and data from vehicles that share major components.”

the report continues...

"Electric vehicles are inherently less complicated than gasoline- or hybrid-powered alternatives, and the Model 3 should be the least complicated Tesla yet,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at CR. “After digging into the data reported by more than 1,500 Tesla Model S owners, we expect the Model 3 should have average reliability. However, since the Model 3 is a new model, we don't expect the above average reliability we are seeing on the Model S.”

then Teslarati reported that Tesla responded to this stating

A Tesla spokesperson commented on Consumer Reports premature “ranking” of the Model 3, saying that the organization’s reporting is “consistently inaccurate” and “misleading”.

“Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how the Model 3 was designed and engineered,” says a Tesla spokesperson. “Time and time again, our own data shows that Consumer Reports’ automotive reporting is consistently inaccurate and misleading to consumers.”


Last Friday CR responded to Tesla


First, Tesla appears unhappy that CR expects the new-to-market Tesla Model 3 to be of average reliability, which is generally a positive projection for any first model year of a car. This expectation is based on CR’s 2017 Annual Reliability Survey, measuring the dependability as opposed to the satisfaction, of more than 300 car models, model year 2000 to 2017, using the responses of individual owners of more than 640,000 vehicles. We provide this information to help people make informed purchasing decisions as new products reach the market.

…how they measure it...

CR conducts a battery of 50 standardized tests across all the vehicles we review – we have a lot of mileage in this arena. We also continuously update our ratings as new surveys are conducted and we test the cars we purchase to reflect the current realities of what a consumer should expect in the marketplace. (That’s right, purchase. CR does not accept any advertising and purchases the products we rate like any other regular person.) The Model S rating has changed over time, going up and down, as new data becomes available.


**My take…**

- Consumer reports is good at what they do
- I understand how an “average” rating doesn’t sit well with Tesla
- This method of surveying existing owners is flawed
- Their review will be legit, at that time I’ll believe what they say about reliability
