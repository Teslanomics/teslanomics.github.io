// Advice from John

### 1 - Reduce your expenses

The first way to start affording a Tesla is to see where you can reduce your current expenses. John recommends targeting your biggest expenses such as your mortgage. If you want it bad enough, consider downsizing to renting a room from your house or apartment.

### 2 - Level up in your job

The next step in affording a Tesla is to ask for a raise in your current job. John used to send his manager weekly status reports so when it came time for a review, he had a stack of his accomplishments with which he could negotiate.

### 3 - Build passive income

The hardest way, but in the long run most rewarding, is to build a passive income to pay for your new Tesla. A great way to get started here is to become a content creator and find your audience. Whether it be on YouTube, Social Media, or a blog, once you have your audience you can start selling to them in various ways to support your Tesla payment.
