The cost of vehicle ownership goes well beyond the cost of a car itself. While the cost of buying a Tesla may be higher than purchasing the average car, powering your electric vehicle can be much more cost effective than “gasing” up. In this week’s episode, we explore just that. Learn more about the costs of charging a Tesla.

Breaking it down even further, we considered Tesla charging costs by location. We took into consideration the costs not only by state, but by provider. Electricity pricing trends can also impact price - and those prices can vary from by electricity company.

On average, the cost to charge a Tesla per month in the US is around $49. Based on our Tesla charging price data, the high end of the EV charging spectrum is around $70 a month in Hawaii. While the low end of spectrum is around $31 a month in Washington state.

The cost of electricity isn’t the only factor in the price per month to charge your Tesla. How you drive and how far you drive will also factor into how much you’ll spend per month to charge your Tesla. Our friends at Teslab provided us with data into how driving style and mileage effects the monthly cost of Tesla ownership.
