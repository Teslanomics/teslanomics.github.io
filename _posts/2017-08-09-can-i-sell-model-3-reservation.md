I've heard a TON about people wanting to either buy or sell a Tesla Model 3 reservation. The fact of the matter is that Tesla does not allow this without their prior written consent. That doesn't prevent you, however, from selling the car immediately after taking ownership. There might be some implications of doing this however so you'll want to beware before acting on any of these ideas.

If you take a look at the reservation agreement, which was attached to the email you received in your confirmation, there is a clause stating "Your Reservation is not transferable or assignable to another party without the prior written approval of Tesla"

So it’s a pretty clear cut answer, right? Well, not exactly...

I wanted to get an expert opinion on this so I called up a friend and fellow YouTuber Franklin Graves and asked his opinion on this...

So since Tesla can cancel your reservation pretty much for any reason, I wouldn’t recommend trying to sell your reservation. Or if you’re thinking about buying a model 3 reservation, know it’s likely a scam and if even it’s real, Tesla could find out and cancel the reservation

In any event, there isn’t really anything that Tesla can do to you once you take delivery of the vehicle. Meaning, you could turn around and sell the car to someone else 5min after taking delivery.

So unless Tesla puts something in the purchase agreement for a Model 3, which is unlikely, you could in theory sell it to someone immediately after taking delivery, and you could even have an agreement with them in advance.

This does bring up the question about taxes, however. The original purchaser of the vehicle is the only one that is eligible for the federal tax credit in the US. And, if you were to take the tax credit as you profits from the sale, you could be taxed on the as income.

So think twice about that and if you are dead set on selling your Model 3 make sure to consult a tax professional beforehand to really understand the implications

So what do you think? 

Would you buy a Model 3 reservation to skip ahead in the line and get yours early? 

How much would you pay?
