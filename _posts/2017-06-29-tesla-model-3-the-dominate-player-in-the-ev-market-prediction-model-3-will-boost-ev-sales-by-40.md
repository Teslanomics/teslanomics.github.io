In Q1 2017, we’ve seen a 47% jump in electric vehicle sales. If we use this as a baseline for each quarter, we’re looking to be up 30% from last year. Recently, I shared my projections for 2017 sales of the Tesla Model 3 – which I predicted will be about 83,000. Learn more about how I got this number here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbzST5TAlEo&t=176s.

This week, we’ll be looking at how the Tesla Model 3 will likely increase EV sales by 40%.This will increase overall EV sales by 82%.

I think sell they'll 5,000 Model 3s per week sometime in late October,. By the end of this year, I think they’ll top out at about 6,000 Model 3s per week. While these estimates won’t be exact, I did use the log growth curve that Elon Musk stated is what Tesla will be use once all the production equipment is installed.

So, with my prediction of 83,000 Tesla Model 3s sold in 2017. we’ll see a total of 286,000 electric vehicles sold in the US this year. That’s a 40% increase due solely to the Tesla Model 3! It’s no wonder Tesla is the dominant player in the EV market - and their stock is soaring.

Here is how I see it playing out: <div id='highcharts-udeciwo'><script src='//cloud.highcharts.com/inject/udeciwo' defer='defer'></script></div>

However, there are skeptics out there as to whether they’ll be able to pull it off. In fact, even I have my doubts. Regardless, even if they’re close, this is going to be a huge year for Tesla and the EV market overall.

Do you think Tesla will be able to pull it off and make this predicted impact? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
