### // Short - Osborn Effect - Reason for Dip

The Osborne effect is a term referring to the unintended consequences of a company announcing a future product, unaware of the risks involved or when the timing is misjudged, which ends up having a negative impact on the sales of the current product. This is often the case when a product is announced too long before its actual availability. This has the immediate effect of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current product, knowing that it will soon be obsolete, and any unexpected delays often means the new product comes to be perceived as vaporware, damaging the company's credibility and profitability.

The term was coined after the Osborne Computer Corporation, in which the company took more than a year to make its next product available and eventually ran out of cash and went bankrupt in 1985.[1][2]

### Tesla Model Y arriving in late 2019 or 2020 on non-Model 3 platform (<a href="http://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-2019-2020-non-model-3-platform/" class="">teslarati</a>)

Elon Musk has announced that the Tesla Model Y electric compact SUV will ride on a different platform than the Model 3, allowing for higher manufacturing efficiency. While Musk hasn’t revealed a large amount of information on the Model Y, he told analysts during today’s Q1 earnings call that contrary to expectations, Model Y will ride on a completely different platform.

The changes in the vehicle’s design will allow for much higher automation in the factory. Musk viewed the Model Y as a crucial piece to reach the 1 million vehicle production target.

Tesla’s future compact SUV is expected to arrive in late 2019 or early 2020 after the company scales up production of the Model 3

### Earnings Call Nuggets (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-05/tesla-has-a-lot-more-in-store-than-the-model-3" class="">bloomerg</a>)

**Model 3 is “close to the bullseye.”** As Tesla approaches the July launch of its first mass-market car, Musk provided details that may assuage nervous investors (and reservation holders). The newest Schuler press line has been powered on, paint shop prep is complete, the welding and assembly lines are coming together, and there have been no major hiccups with the test cars. “It’s been pretty close to the bullseye,” Musk said. “I don’t know anything that would prevent us from starting production in July and exceeding 5,000 units a week by the end of the year.”

**Tesla is building its own bodyshops.** Following criticism about wait times for body work, Tesla will launch a new network of company-owned bodyshops. It's also opening 100 new retail, delivery, and service locations in anticipation of the Model 3. When customers need to have work done in the future, Musk said, the loaner vehicles they’ll receive will all be top-of-the-line P100D versions of the Model S and Model X.

**Tesla is adding mobile repair trucks, too.** Most repairs don’t require a car lift, Musk said, and mobile trucks are cheaper and more convenient. “Proactive service”—where Tesla identifies problems remotely before the driver is even aware of them—and the ability to efficiently schedule service “more than offsets” the cost of driving to meet customers, Musk said. For bigger problems, the service centers are expanding, some with as many as 80 car lifts.

**Energy storage is about to take off.** There’s been a delay between the first and second generations of Tesla’s Powerwall home battery, and utility-scale Powerpack sales have been concentrated among only a handful of large projects. Musk sees “quite a dramatic ... like really dramatic” ramp in battery storage coming toward the end of 2017. The Nevada Gigafactory is on track to surpass its goal of 35 gigawatt hours of battery cell production in 2018, Musk said, and the company expects to ultimately produce more than 100 gigawatt hours at that location.
