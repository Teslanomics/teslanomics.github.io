In the past week the Tesla stock (TSLA) lost nearly ten percent in two days only to gain back about three percent since. It&#8217;s a rollercoaster for sure as I mentioned in my last video reviewing the 2016 Tesla financial statements.

This week I introduce a new segment I&#8217;d like to do called Long and Short. This is where I borrow terms from the economy, and this segment from one of my favorite shows (Marketplace Weekend) and talk about things I&#8217;m for (long) and things I&#8217;m not (short), related to Tesla.

For my long, I went with Elon Musk remaining on Trump&#8217;s advisory board. I think this is a smart move for the company, and the future of sustainable energy as well as transportation in this country. They&#8217;re one of the few manufacturing companies that are growing at a tremendous pace, and I&#8217;m happy that Elon has a voice at the table when talking with the president.

For my short, I was sad to read about the female engineer that is suing Tesla over &#8220;pervasive harassment.&#8221; In her article, she describes being passed over by male co-workers for promotions and being sexually harassed on the factory floor. It&#8217;s surprising to me that this would be happening at Tesla, however, in all fairness, Tesla did release a statement from an independent investigation they did which concluded there was no basis for her claims. This is unlike the recent report from an Uber engineer who repeatedly was told by their HR team to stop complaining.

I feel that Tesla is doing their diligence here and I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t the last we&#8217;ll hear of it, but it certainly is disheartening, especially as someone who has worked in an engineering field for most of my career.

As mentioned the stock has been on a rollercoaster ride since the earnings call on Feb 22nd, where basically they reported everything is going smooth. For whatever reason Goldman Sach&#8217;s decided to change their recommendation on the Tesla stock from neutral to sell. This triggered another near 5% drop two days after the earnings call.

Goldman did mention that this is short-term thinking, which is what the markest are all about, and that in the long-term they think the company is fine.

This mindset really bothers me, which is why I&#8217;m hoping Eric Reis&#8217; new Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) takes off. The idea there is that the current markets encourage short-term thinking to make the biggest profit in the quickest time span. This may help some investors, and hurt others, but in the long run, the companies and our economy suffer.

It&#8217;s like if all you ate was chocolate. Sure, you&#8217;ll feel good in the short-term, but you may not live past a few months on that alone.

That&#8217;s all for this week in Teslanomics, don&#8217;t forget to use our referral code for your purchase of a new Model S or X and Signup on our email list for early access to future deals and t-shirts.
