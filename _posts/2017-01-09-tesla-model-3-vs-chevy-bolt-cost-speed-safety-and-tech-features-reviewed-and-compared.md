Affordable Electric Vehicles are finally hitting the market. Both the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevy Bolt a priced to sell and could change transportation as we know it. The Chevy Bolt sports some impressive features, killing the range anxiety many held. The Tesla Model 3 also delivers on this and could close to 300mi of range on a single charge if you want to believe the rumors. Both cars are fast, the Chevy Bolt clocking in at 0-60 in under 6.5 seconds while the Tesla Model 3 makes it in under 6sec. Elon Musk has also hinted that there might be ludicrous mode available on the Model 3 giving it even speedier results.

The Chevy Bolt is available now at your local Chevy dealer, although when I tried to find one for a test drive, none of them were in yet. The Tesla Model 3 will require some patience. Elon recently tweeted that &#8220;Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I&#8217;d recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery” so depending on what you want to read into that, you may be waiting for two years before getting your Model 3.

When looking at the Tech for both of these cars, they’re decent. The Chevy Bolt has some fun features like wireless charging for your mobile devices and support for Apple Airplay and Android Auto. Both have a 4G LTE internet connections however only the Chevy Bolt will let you tether your phone to it. The Tesla Model 3 on the other hand ships with full self-driving hardware and for an upgrade fee will include autopilot. Autopilot and the self-driving ability is a big distinction to me. On the one hand, they’re both techie cars, but only the Tesla Model 3 has the ambition to become a fully autonomous vehicle one day. Not to mention the Over-The-Air (OTA) software upgrades which continually improve your Tesla.

When comparing the price of these two cars, I feel they’re close enough that it won&#8217;t change your mind either way. It is almost negligible to me but perhaps the Chevy could be a bit better if you can get the federal tax rebates before they run out.

One huge factor though that I think will ruin Chevy’s chance, at least with this car, to become a major player in the EV market is the look of the car. Some friends of mine went to an auto show here in California recently and were unimpressed with the Bolt. They mentioned the interior was cramped and the look was more of a minivan instead of a fun coupe. The one area where the Chevy Bolt beats the Tesla Model 3 here is the trunk. In the Model 3, the trunk has been compromised to provide more headroom in the back seat whereas the Bolt has a hatchback which the seats fold down to provide ample storage.

All in all, I’m thrilled to see affordable EVs hitting the market and wish both cars great success. The last question to answer is for you. Which one will/would you buy? What features are most important to you? Let me know in the comments below and thanks for watching!
