  This week we start with a story from Steven Turner. Steven shared a great story with me recently about how he used our referral code to buy his new Tesla Model S and what it really means to him. You have to listen to his email.

  Tesla blogged that their planning to expand their supercharger network! I'm not suggesting it is in response to my video last week but the timing does seem suspicious :)

"We started 2017 with over 5,000 Superchargers globally and by the end of this year, Tesla will double that number to total more than 10,000 Superchargers and 15,000 Destination Charging connectors around the world. In North America, we’ll increase the number of Superchargers by 150 percent, and in California alone, we’ll add more than 1,000 Superchargers. We’re moving full speed on site selection and many sites will soon enter construction to open in advance of the summer travel season.”

"Toward that goal, Tesla will build larger sites along our busiest travel routes that will accommodate several dozen Teslas Supercharging simultaneously. “

Tesla also issued a recall for some 53,000 Model S and X vehicles. The recall is related to a parking break and they seem to think it could never cause someone harm but wanted to be abundantly cautious.

Some folks in San Francisco (of course) are suing Tesla over Autopilot 2 functionality. Saying that they are basically beta testers and that they were lied to. As the most sue happy state this doesn't surprise me but C'MON MAN! Tesla never said that this is a fully complete feature and they know they would be waiting for the complete functionality to be released in an over-the-air update sometime in the future.

If it were 2020 and they still didn't have it fine, but now?
