The Tesla Model 3 has been called a mass-market vehicle, but honestly that’s not true. It’s really an entry-level luxury sedan that does pretty well compared to it’s peers. // Get updates like these in your inbox https://teslanomics.co/join

Today we’re going to take a look at how the Tesla Model 3 stacks up against the BMW 3-series, and MB C-class. When it comes to the entry-level luxury or compact executive cars, you’re taking about sedans’ under 50K that offer a great driving experience. The class leader for a long time has been the BMW 3 series, and for a good reason. The BMW 3-series offers a classic look with premium finishes and high acceleration. The 2017 3-Series offers loads of options that can make it work for nearly any budget. For many, this car is a timeless classic. 

In 2017 BMW has revised their naming of the various trim levels and revised exterior trim, interior color options, with the Sport and Luxury lines being wrapped up int into separate packages

The sedan version of the 3-series is BMW’s bread and butter; they also offer a sport wagon and Gran Turismo body style. Another class-leader is the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.

The C-Class is no longer Mercedes only option in the entry-level luxury category offers loads of powertrain options and body styles. They have three high-performance AMG models to choose from, and as you might expect, the interior finishes are second to none in this category.

In 2017 Mercedes added the rearview camera as standard equipment and put out some new colors for you to choose from. To round it out we have the Audi A4.

The Audi A4 is another compact sedan introduced in the US in the late 90’s. It has a timeless design similar to BMW and offers decent acceleration with some cool tech inside. The new 2017 Audi A4 has a “virtual cockpit” with a 12.3” screen that replaces the traditional gauges and buttons. 

So we know who the leaders are, now let’s see how the Model 3 fairs...

The Tesla Model 3, released just this past July, is making major waves in the affordable luxury segment. While it’s been called a mass-market car with a base price of 35K, we know that the options you’ll want quickly add up to push it into the 50K range.

The interior is completely free of buttons and controlled by a 15” center console that Tesla placed flawlessly for both driver and passenger use. Every Model 3 comes with the hardware to one day become fully self-driving and already offers Enhanced Auto-PIlot making those hours spent in traffic a little more bearable. Because Tesla mounted the motor underneath the rear seat, the Model 3 includes a sizable trunk as well as a small trunk for storing additional items.
