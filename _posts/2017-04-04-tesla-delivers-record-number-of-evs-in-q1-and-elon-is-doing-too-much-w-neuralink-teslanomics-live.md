First, I have to apologize for my Max Hedrum impression here. This was my first time going live with my new studio, and I&#8217;m obviously having some issues. The audio seems to be fine but the video is choppy so if you want to skip this one no hard feelings, but I did answer loads of questions and share some interesting data, so your call.

This also inspired me to start doing live streams every Monday where I take a look at my Long and Short for the week prior. Those are the news items I&#8217;m betting on (Long) and that I&#8217;m betting against (short) related to Tesla. Also, I&#8217;ll be taking your questions live, or you can submit them in advance <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSsNjWHs5fLUKrdV9PNa26e7wuOURzr2v3QXWjNhSj8ohlIw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>.

Thanks and see you back here soon!

Tesla Delivers a record number of EVs in Q1, and their stock goes soaring! Up 7% on the day! I am thrilled by this but at the same time, the amount of growth over Q1 of the last year wasn&#8217;t that impressive. Still, this is a positive sign and hopefully a good indication that the Model 3 is on track for July.

For my short this week, Elon is doing too much. From the Verge

&#8220;SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is backing a brain-computer interface venture called Neuralink, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence and has no public presence whatsoever, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the ultimate purpose of helping people merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.&#8221;

Join me here each week for a live update as I take a look at the previous week and give you my take on it using the economic terms Long and Short.

Also, thanks for those that support me and the team on Patreon! Without your support this wouldn&#8217;t be possible, so thank you for everything, and I hope to see you there.
