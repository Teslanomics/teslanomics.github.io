It&#8217;s been nearly a full year since I purchased my Tesla Model S. In that time I&#8217;ve completely fell in love with this company, their mission, and most of all their products. I&#8217;m looking forward to receiving our Model 3 sometime next year and also adding a Powerwall 2.0 to our home. All that said, I&#8217;m clearly biased, so take the following data with a grain of salt (and or tequila).

My wife asked me recently&#8230;how much are we saving from the Tesla? Being the data geek I am, I couldn&#8217;t resist but to do some analysis on this and try to answer the question. So this is where my curiosity took me. I have also heard this question from lots of friends interested in buying a Tesla. The basic question is

&#8220;How much per month does it cost in electricity?&#8221;

In San Diego, where I live, the local electricity company offers a special EV rate so I end up paying about $0.18/kWH. I work from home so I don&#8217;t drive much, making the actual dollar savings relatively small. And I&#8217;m still investigating if there are any times when the car is pulling electricity but doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be (eg. Vampire Mode)

So here&#8217;s how I went about answering this question and analyzing the data. Hope this helps you in your journey!

## Data Sources

  1. Data from my electricity provider, SDGE
  2. Milage data from MileIQ
  3. Historical Gas prices from Gas Buddy
  4. Estimated MPG for a full-size sedan (equivalent to a model S)

## The Data

## My Approach

  * Determine my monthly cost for powering the Tesla
  * Calculate the approximate cost of driving in a legacy gas-powered sedan
  * Subtract the two to determine monthly savings
