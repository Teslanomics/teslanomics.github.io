While the Tesla Model 3 isn&#8217;t yet ready, we can estimate the cost using some historical data and your own user preferences for upgrades. In this video, I take a look at the user entered budgets from Model3Tracker.info and see how much you&#8217;re willing to pay for your Tesla Model 3.

Looking back at my analysis of the most popular features for the Tesla Model 3 I found that Autopilot 2.0 and the Battery reigned supreme. The big question left unanswered from that analysis was how much it might cost, and if people were willing to pay for it.

Here, we have some data from you, the Tesla Model 3 reservation holders, about what you&#8217;re willing to pay. My best guess is that most people will pay around fifty thousand dollars USD after all the upgrades. And lucky enough, this is what our data shows.

If you haven&#8217;t already please go to https://model3tracker.info and enter your preferences so we can update this and gain an even deeper insight into what the historic launch of the Tesla Model 3 will end up being.
