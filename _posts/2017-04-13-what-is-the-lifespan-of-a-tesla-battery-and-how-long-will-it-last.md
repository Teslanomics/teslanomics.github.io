Haters love to claim that the Tesla car batteries, the ones that power the car, will only last 2 years or less. Well, now we have some data coming from actual owners and their experiences.

As the data shows owners are experiencing greater than 93% battery retention after 220,000 miles of driving. This is incredible as many owners aren&#8217;t likely to drive their car this far nor retain the car for much after.

These data are encouraging that owners of used CPO Teslas, like myself, will have a great time ahead of ourselves without any worry about replacing the battery.
