Last week Tesla released their 2016 Q4 and full-year financial report. In the report, they highlighted some significant growth numbers as well as a few updates on the Model 3.

**<a href="http://teslanomics.co/td" target="_blank">Get $1K off your new Tesla Model S or Model X</a>**

The highlights from 2016 are

&#8211; 76K sales

&#8211; YoY Revenue +88%

&#8211; Auto Revenue +79%

&#8211; 11.5M in Storage Revenue (e.g. batteries)

&#8211; Cash Flow +183%

The model 3 news wasn&#8217;t earth-shattering but may have left some wanting more. Specifically, Elon said on the earnings call that they do not plan on revealing more info about the design until close to or even after initial production begins. By delaying the configuration until this time it will give them time to iron out the kinks with the employees being the first to receive their cars.

The net income wasn&#8217;t as good as expected, they are still running at a loss, but solid growth figures offset this. Analysts weren&#8217;t pleased, and the market responded accordingly. The one thing to know about the Tesla stock is that it is volatile. If you&#8217;re looking to make a quick buck, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it. Do your research and talk to your financial advisor first.
