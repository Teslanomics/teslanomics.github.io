The Tesla Model 3 is possibly the most analyzed and hyped car in a decade or more. With many details still undisclosed, several sites have been created to help future owners estimate everything from price to delivery date. In this video, I look at some data sourced from Model3Tracker.info that shows which upgrades are the most popular across the globe.

**Add your reservation today at <a href="https://model3tracker.info/" target="_blank">https://model3tracker.info/</a>**

First, we start by looking at data for the United States, where the largest number of Model 3 reservations are held. Then for each state, we look at the top feature, and I even have a dashboard you can use to see which cities have the most reservations as well as which upgraded features are the most attractive for that state.

I also built a similar map for Canada. This dashboard shows the most popular upgrade for Model 3 reservation holders in each province. From there you can click on the province and see the breakdown of most popular upgrades as well as where the reservations are held inside that province.

For the EU it was a bit more challenging to create the map by each state or province since the name field in the data source is free-form text. So for the EU I built the same dashboard but by country. The same functionality exists in this dashboard as does in the other two.
