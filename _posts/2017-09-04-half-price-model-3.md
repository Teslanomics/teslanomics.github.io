##// LONG - New EV Incentive in CA Could Result in Half-Priced Model 3 [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-ev-rebate-status-20170901-story.html)

- Proposed Legislation in CA could increase EV rebates to 10K or more
- Bill AB-1184 proposed by Assembly Member Ting in Feb of 2017
- Vote scheduled for Sept 15th, 2017

"The bill directs the state Air Resources Board to devise a formula for car rebates. A single rebate amount would be set that would account for the difference in price between a compact electric car and a traditionally powered compact car, according to the bill.

Sponsor Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) has suggested a Chevy Bolt EV could be compared against the best-selling compact in California, which right now is the Honda Civic. That could mean a rebate of $8,000 to $10,000 or more.

Ting told The Times last week that a lid could be put on the sticker price of a qualifying car, perhaps $50,000.” - LA Times


**Bill Text**

(m) Incentives for electric zero-emission vehicles will further the following goals:
(1) One million zero-emission vehicles by 2022 and establishing a self-sustaining market, as stated in the Charge Ahead California Initiative (Chapter 8.5 (commencing with Section 44258) of Part 5 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code).
(2) Governor Brown’s target of 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025.
(3) Governor Brown’s recent public statements to set a further ambitious target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2030, to be on track to achieve an 80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 2050.

##// Tesloop eHawk hits 300K mi, only 10K in maintenance

Tesla Model S Hits 300k Miles with less than $11k maintenance costs
Car 2.0 Mobility Service Tesloop Leverages Economics of Tesla’s Electric Platform

LA-based Tesloop, a city to city mobility service that utilizes Tesla vehicles, has reached the milestone of 300,000 miles (482,800 km) on its first car, a Tesla Model S, which launched the service in 2015. The vehicle, affectionately named “eHawk”, hit the 300k milestone on Tuesday August 29th 2017. Tesloop’s fleet, which, other than this car, is comprised of exclusively Tesla Model X vehicles, travel as much as 17,000 miles per car each month.

During the first 300,000 miles the total combined maintenance and fuel costs of the Tesla Model S were $10,492, with a total of 12 days in the shop. Of these costs, $6,900 was scheduled maintenance and $3500 was headlight damage due to driving through deep water. Had this been an Mercedes S class, the scheduled routine maintenance and fuel would have been $86,000 ($52k maintenance and $36k* fuel) with 112 days of servicing, or for a Lincoln Town Car $70,00 ($28k maintenance and $42k** fuel) with around 100 days of servicing.

“Over the last two years, we have seen that that electric, supercharged vehicles can be deployed at utilization levels unheard of with gas vehicles. And while saving over $60,000 on fuel and maintenance is a substantial economic win, we feel the bigger win is that this car is ready for another 900,000 miles over the next 6 years under its current warranty.  A gas car with 300k miles would be near the end of its useful lifespan.  This means that the economics for mobility services on electric is more attractive than non-electric vehicles by a multiple, and when combined with autonomous driving features, the economic advantage in cost per mile will  create unprecedented disruption in the overall automotive industry.”

Tesloop has published full service records for this vehicle, which can be viewed on their site, along with detailed photos.


##// Cummins Electric Semi [Green Car Reports](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1112434_cummins-electric-semi-truck-traditional-maker-takes-on-tesla)

The traditional diesel-engine maker debuted its Urban Hauler Tractor, a Class 7 semi truck with a 44,000-pound payload. Notably, the company called the semi truck a concept that previews a production truck Cummins believes could arrive at the end of this decade. If not the truck itself, Cummins is confident the powertrain will be ready for production by that time; the company promises 100 miles of range. That figure is well below what Tesla's electric-semi truck is rumored to offer: Tesla's electric semi will reportedly have a 200- to 300-mile range.


##// Model 3 Production [twitter](https://twitter.com/theteslashow/status/903840472396832768)

"Tesla is up to (at least) VIN 200 on production Model 3. 50 in July. 150 in August would put them ahead of schedule.”

Is this good or bad news? Will they hit the 200k mark this year?

##// SHORT - Tesla vs Labor Board [Teslarati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-fires-back-us-labor-board-complaint/)

The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint Thursday against Tesla, saying the company required workers to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would prevent employees from discussing working conditions and safety at the Fremont plant.

Tesla has already responded to the NLRB’s complaint.

“As we approach Labor Day weekend, there’s a certain irony in just how far the UAW has strayed from the original mission of the American labor movement,” Tesla said in a statement. “Faced with declining membership, an overwhelming loss at a Nissan plant earlier this month, corruption charges that were recently leveled against union leaders who misused UAW funds, and failure to gain traction with our employees, it’s no surprise the union is feeling pressured to continue its publicity campaign against Tesla.”

Tesla further slammed the UAW for its role in trying to disrupt the Tesla production process, alleging that members even went as far as visiting the homes of Tesla employees.

“For seven years, the UAW has used every tool in its playbook: misleading and outright false communications, unsolicited and unwelcomed visits to the homes of our employees, attempts to discredit Tesla publicly in the media, and now another tactic that has been used in every union campaign since the beginning of time – baseless ULP filings that are meant only to generate headlines.”

The NLRB has also established a court date in November to address the charges at hand. Tesla has largely denied all allegations that call workers’ safety at the Fremont plant into question.

“These allegations, which have been filed by the same contingent of union organizers who have been so outspoken with media, are entirely without merit,” Tesla said in a statement.

Green Car Reports -
Dethleffs solar-assisted electric motorhome concept unveiled
The German company has installed 334 square feet of solar panels to generate electricity and help provide power to its electric powertrain.
The all-electric motor home uses an 80-kilowatt (107-horsepower) electric motor that could be paired to a few different battery options, according to the company.
The highest possible range envisioned is 174 miles, though that's rated on the more generous New European Driving Cycle; a comparable EPA rating might be closer to 140 miles.
Finishes and furniture are also trimmed in high-quality materials; there's a kitchen, bathroom, flat-screen television, and sleeping quarters with privacy window panes.

 - Federal judge rules in favor of Tesla: Michigan lawmakers must surrender records of their communications with ‘Anti-Tesla’ lobbyists
 - “Tesla is entitled to documents that evidence the intent and coordination that took place behind the scenes while the Legislature effectively gave franchised dealers a state-sponsored monopoly on car sales within Michigan – all while engineering the legislative process to steadfastly remove any public attention or scrutiny.” read a statement by Tesla via attorney John Bursch at the time.


##// Solar Cell Production Begins in Buffalo [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-starts-production-of-solar-cells-in-buffalo/2017/08/31/1a87c04a-8e72-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html)

“By the end of this year we will have the ramp-up of solar roof modules started in a substantial way,” Straubel told The Associated Press Thursday. “This is an interim milestone that we’re pretty proud of.”

The Buffalo plant was originally begun by Silevo, a solar panel startup, on the site of an old steel mill. Solar panel maker SolarCity Corp. bought Silevo in 2014. Then Tesla acquired SolarCity for around $2 billion late last year. SolarCity was run by cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who sat on SolarCity’s board.

“This factory, and the opportunity to build solar modules and cells in the U.S., was part of why this project made sense,” Straubel said.
