##// SHORT - CA Dealers Referral Program Compliant - [Clean Technica](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/09/17/super-helpful-california-car-dealers-association-expands-complaint-tesla-referral-program/)

"The California New Car Dealers Association has expanded its complaint against Tesla in relation to the modern electric car pioneer’s use of customer referral programs. The California New Car Dealers Association has sent yet another letter to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles explaining how cruel and unfair Tesla’s approach is.”

Automotive News provides more: “The CNCDA claims Tesla’s various referral programs engage in ‘bird-dogging’ practices, enticing owners with incentives to act as unlicensed sales people. California law states that it is illegal for a company to offer rebates, discounts or commissions to anyone without a sales license on the condition that they sell, or aid in the selling, of that company’s goods.”

- This has been a big part of the auto industry for a while

- I agree it’s unfair, it should be totally legal to pay referees just like many other companies
- Tons of other products are fine, why not cars?
- The CNCDA should compete, not complain
- To be clear, the Tesla referral program does not offer financial compensation

##// LONG - New Long-Range Samsung EV Batteries  [Teslarati](http://www.teslarati.com/samsung-tesla-long-range-400mi-battery-technology/)

"Samsung SDI revealed its latest battery technology at the Frankfurt Motor Show this week that could challenge Tesla for long range battery supremacy. Samsung’s cylindrical lithium ion cells when grouped into battery modules will reportedly extend electric vehicle range to 600 to 700 kilometers (372 to 435 miles).” - Teslarati

“Its users can change the number of modules as they want as if they place books on a shelf,” says Samsung. “For example, if 20 modules are installed in a premium car, it can go 600 to 700 kilometers. If 10 to 12 modules are mounted on a regular sedan, it can run up to 300 kilometers. This pack is expected to catch the eyes of automakers, because they can design a car whose mileage may vary depending on how many modules of a single pack are installed.”

- Better EV batteries = More Competition = Cheaper Prices & Better EVs
