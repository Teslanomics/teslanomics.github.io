For many, choosing between a **model S and model X** will come down to your needs. Whether that be you have a larger family and need the extra seating, or you want to sit up higher than the rest of traffic and get a better view of what's going on.

In any event, there are a lot of factors to consider. In this episode I'm excited to have **Zac from Now You Know** join me and break down the differences between the Tesla Model S and X to help you decide which is right for you.

First, we look at Price. This should be no surprise that the Model X is a bit more expensive. For the **price** of a nicely outfitted **Model X**, you could get almost a fully loaded **Model S**. Zac paid ~137K for his Tesla Model X and comparing this to the Model S, that would have been ~104K. Both of these figures are before the **Federal EV Tax Credit** and any state incentives.

When it comes to insurance, there are many variables that would change your price. In our scenario here we found that for a **Model X** you might see **$1,600 per year** while the same **Model S** would be **$1,200 per year**. Of course, this depends on things like driving history, location, and other discounts you may receive.

For fuel, the **Model ****S** ticks in about 15% better. This makes sense since it's a lighter vehicle, but like insurance could be impacted by many factors. One big factor here to consider is if you live in a colder climate like Zac does. When the batteries are colder they tend to use more juice to move the car forward.

When it comes to maintenance, neither of us have had any notable issues to speak of. For this category, we call it a wash. In another video I did I compared what a Tesla would be versus a high-end luxury sedan. View that video [here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1BI9P1qcAY)

The biggest difference between the two vehicles, we both agree, is the functionality. They're both incredibly stylish, although arguably the Falcon-Wing doors are more eye-catching. When it comes down to it, if you have a family of 5 or more, you'll have a hard time fitting everyone in the **Model S**. The **Model X **will handle this no problem, and there are even multiple seat configurations now available.

Either way, we both agree, you'll be happy with your purchase :)
