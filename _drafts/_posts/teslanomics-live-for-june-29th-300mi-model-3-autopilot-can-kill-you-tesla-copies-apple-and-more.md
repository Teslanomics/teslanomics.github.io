**// Tesla Model S Goes 560mi on a single charge ([teslarati](http://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-p100d-record-560-mi-901-km-single-charge/))**

"Steven Peeters had a dream for his Tesla Model S P100D, to break the world record for longest trip in an electric vehicle on a single charge.

The previous record, depending on how it’s viewed, was held by early Model S adopter and YouTuber Bjørn Nyland when his P85D made it 452.79 mi (728.7 km) on just one charge. The other record, arguably more impressive because the driver Casey Spencer managed to drive his Model S 85D 26+ hours continuously and at a snail’s pace without restroom breaks, registered 550.3 mi (885.62 km) with 0 mi left on the display, besting Nyland by over 100 mi (161 km). However, and admittedly, Spencer noted that there was a downhill segment of the record setting journey which many believed to be an unfair advantage.” - Mike Dolzer (Teslarati)

**// Tesla Driver In Fatal Florida Crash Got Numerous Warnings To Take Control Back From Autopilot ([jalopnik](http://jalopnik.com/tesla-driver-in-fatal-florida-crash-got-numerous-warnin-1796226021))**

"The new details of the crash were revealed in more than 500 pages of records collected as part of the National Transportation Safety Board’s ongoing investigation into the 2016 incident.” - Jalopnik

"The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said “Hands Required Not Detected.”

In six cases, the system then sounded a chime before it returned to “Hands Required Detected” for one to three second periods.”

- It had to happen eventually, hopefully, this will be the last...

**// Long - New Model 3 Photos, 300mi Range ([teslarati](http://www.teslarati.com/new-model-3-photos-surface-pointing-300-mile-range-interior-details/))**

- Great photos, the tech was cool w/ it

- Little bummed these folks get a better look then we did at the “VIP Showing”

"The screen clearly shows the vehicle’s charge level at 95 miles and was charging at 169 mph (worth noting that the stall next to the Model 3 was drawing power as well). After taking a closer look at the vehicle’s charge level, it looks to us that this particular vehicle has a range over 300 miles (312 miles to be exact)”
