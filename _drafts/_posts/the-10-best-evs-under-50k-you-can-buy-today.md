I'm here today to help you break down the top 10 Electric Vehicles (EVs) you can buy today.

### #10 - Mercedes-Benz B-Class

If you're a fan of Mercedes, then this might be a good option for you. However, there are much better options for the price. A hatchback this car is roomy and will serve you well, but for over $40K you can do better for your money.

### #9 - Fiat 500e

This fun and sporty ultra-compact car will serve you well if you're in a big city that is short on parking spaces. With 87mi of range this car is lower on the range spectrum, but at $32,500 it may be worth it if the body style suits your needs.

### #8 - Nissan Leaf

A classic EV, the Leaf is only low on the list because Nissan is going to unveil a new model in late 2017. If you like this model, I would wait until Fall of 2017 to see if the new one is worth the upgrade.

### #7 - Toyota Prius Prime

This is a Prius. The 'Prime' version is a Plugin-Electric Hybrid (PHEV) that gets 25mi of range solely on electricity before dipping into the gas reserve. I wouldn't typically include this, but I wanted to add it as an option in case you're still hesitant about going fully electric.

### #6 - Hyundai Ioniq EV

This is a beautiful EV with a range of over 120mi making it one of the more capable in the market today. A stylish look and hatchback gives you fashion and function for your commuting needs. And, retailing under 30K makes this an attractive option.

### #5 - Volkswagen E-Golf

VW has an all-electric version of their popular Golf model that gets 125mi of range (estimated) and costs around $36K. Not bad for a company reeling from the vehicle emissions scandal still. If you like VW and need an EV now, this is a good option, but if you can wait they are rumored to be coming out with an entire fleet of EVs in 2018.

### #4 - Kia Soul EV

Not quite in the top 3, the Kia Soul EV clocks in at number four on my list simply because of its different style. With a range of 93mi and a $33K price it's nothing too impressive, but with its unique style and copious amounts of storage, the Kia Soul EV could be a fun option for some.

### #3 - Ford Focus Electric

Ford has transformed themselves into the US car market into a tech powerhouse. The Ford Focus Electric is a sign of their future direction and what they're capable of producing. Going 115mi on a single charge this model fairs better than many of the first generation EVs and is still priced below $30K to start.

### #2 - BMW i3

The BMW i3 has an excellent build quality and for beemer fans will be their EV of choice. With 114mi of range, it should quell most drivers range anxiety needs except those with longer commutes. And, going from 0-60 in 7.7 sec means you won't feel like you're driving an "electric" car. The one drawback about the BMW i3 is it's $41K price tag, but hey, it's a BMW.

### #1 - Chevy Bolt

The Chevy Bolt is the first of the 2nd generation EVs on the market and is a fantastic option. With an estimated range of 238mi, a price tag of under 40K, and 0-60 time of 6.3sec this car is a crowd pleaser. Originally I had this low on my list due to Chevy's reluctance to roll it out widely, but they have recently stated they'll be offering it up nationwide in the US and the EU under the Opel brand.

### ## Bonus! - Used Tesla Model S

Since Tesla launched autopilot, many owners have traded their cars in and bought new ones. This has flooded the used Tesla site with Model S's for under 50K, some even close to 32K!

The Tesla Model S isn't in the same class as the rest of these vehicles with its 210mi range (est. for used models), advanced interior tech, and supercharger network. If your budget is in the 40-50K range you should seriously consider a used Tesla. You can find more at [http://tesla.com/used](http://tesla.com/used)
