## // The Long - Electric Car Boom is Here

* Oil major Total SA syas EVs will drive 30% of car sales by 2030 ([bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/electric-car-boom-seen-triggering-peak-oil-demand-in-2030s))

* Battery prices are dropping about 20% each year

* In 2018, Volkswagen plows into electrification with an Audi SUV and the first high-speed U.S. charging network to rival Tesla’s Superchargers.

* Jaguar and Volvo Cars both have promising cars on the way too, and by 2020, the avalanche really begins, with Mercedes-Benz, VW, General Motors Co. and others releasing dozens of new models.

**VW $10B Investment ([electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/04/28/vw-invesment-electric-vehicles/))**

* Volkswagen chief executive Matthias Müller conceded that “the future of driving is electric”

China continues it’s push towards EVs ([npr](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/04/25/525412342/china-moves-to-increase-number-of-electric-vehicles-on-its-roads))

* By early next year, Beijing will require automakers in China to ensure that at least 8 percent of all vehicles they manufacture are electric. The country had more than 1 million electric vehicles in 2016 — an 87 percent increase over the previous year. Vehicles range in price from $6,000 to $200,000 (for the most expensive Tesla model).

Boring Company Cost - ([teslarati](http://www.teslarati.com/boring-company-cost-cutting-plan-boring-company-cheaper-faster-tunnel-digging/))

“To withstand the water table, you have to design a wall to be able to withstand 5 or 6 atmospheres. To go to vacuum, you only need to be able to withstand 1 atmosphere.”

## // Tesla News

### // // Model 3 (from TED talk)

* “Looking good for starting production in July” - Musk

* Using only passive optical cameras and GPS, no LIDAR, the Model 3 will be capable of autonomous driving. “Once you solve cameras for vision, autonomy is solved; if you don’t solve vision, it’s not solved … You can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras.”

* LA to NY w/o touching the controls by this Nov-Dec?

### // // Tesla Semi

* “With the Tesla Semi, we want to show that an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi. If you had a tug of war competition, the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill,” - Musk

### // // Solar Roof

* Some tiles have solar cells, some do not

* less than (cost of roof + cost of electricity)

* thought about warranty be infinity, well after the house has collapsed, the glass tiles will still be there

* Rolling out w/ 2 types, 2 new types next year

* How many houses - eventually all will have solar roof (40-50yrs)

### // // Gigafactory (Falling price of batteries)

* Announce location for 2-4 later this year “Global Market"

### // // Mars?

* SpaceX is building a massive rocket the size of a 40 story building

* Why not just take care of stuff on earth?

Sustainable energy will happen no matter what, out of necessity, Musk says. “If you don’t have sustainable energy, you have unsustainable energy … The fundamental value of a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy faster than it would otherwise occur,” he says.

But becoming a multi-planet species isn’t inevitable. “If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 we were able to send somebody to the moon. Then we had the space shuttle, which could only take people to low-Earth orbit. Now we take no one to orbit. That’s the trend — it’s down to nothing. We’re mistaken when we think technology automatically improves. It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better.”
