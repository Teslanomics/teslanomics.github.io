<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><b>// Short - Tesla in India? (<a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/05/23/government-to-tesla-no-local-sourcing-required-for-manufacturing-in-india">bloomberg</a>)</b></span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">- Elon tweeted that 30% of parts must be locally sourced in India</span>

- India Gov't responded that it’s not true

- Too much too soon IMHO

“With respect to news reports on launch plans of Tesla in India being delayed, please note some key clarifications #MakeInIndia”

* The clarifications included,

* 1. Not correct. FDI policy of India does not mandate any such minimum sourcing of components by manufacturers.

* 2. After manufacturing in India, a foreign investor is permitted to sell in any manner: wholesale, retail including e-commerce.

* 3. FDI policy also permits wholesale of imported goods in India without sourcing conditions.

* 4. It is only for the retail trading of goods, that sourcing conditions are mandated. Conditions not applicable to manufacturers as goods are manufactured in India.

**// Long - German Gigafactory ([bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-22/move-over-tesla-europe-s-building-its-own-battery-gigafactories))**

- Global battery capacity set to double by 2021 and slash costs

- Daimler joins Tesla in investing in battery factory capacity

- Battery costs could fall 43% in 4 years making EVs cheaper by 2023

- More Gigafactories? Battery production tripling by 2021

- 2030 6M EVs in Germany

I love this as Europe needs to step up its game in order to meet their Paris Climate agreement goals.

**// New Model 3 Details ([tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/compare))**

Tesla updated the chart for comparison

They modified the ones listed under the Model S and added some under Model 3:

* Full Self-Driving Capability

* Aluminum and Steel Body

* Coil Suspension

* Optional Glass Roof

* 18″ or 19″ Wheels

**// Up Close Model 3 Photos (<a href="http://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-interior-dashboard-center-console/" class="">teslarati</a>)**

- Dash super interesting

- Panel gaps?

- Color?

The Model 3 is looking great. There still seem to be some issues to work out but overall I think it will be a head turner.

**// Tesla Model S Sales Dominate Luxury Market ([electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/05/26/tesls-model-s-leading-us-large-luxury-segment/))**

- Tesla’s Model S outsells Mercedes S-Class, Porsche Panamera, and BMW 6/7 Series combined in the US

Forget that Tesla is an EV. It's the best car in its class, regardless and recent data shows it.
