Currently, the Tesla Model 3 batteries being made at Gigafactory 1 in Reno, NV are manually assembled. Workers carefully remove the battery cells from the boxes and compile them into complete modules which they then later combine into the full car battery. With nearly 75 workers on the assembly line running 24 hours a day (75 emps * 2 shifts = 150 total) they are managing about 20 modules per day. That's is a paltry pace and extremely expensive. So Tesla decided it's time to upgrade.

On May 24th, Elon Musk approved a $216M capital expenditure for the battery line equipment necessary to hit their 5,000 per week production goal later this year.

We received a detailed budget for this equipment and wanted to share that with you here.

The main message I see in this story is that the Model 3 production will be starting in July. In addition, the annual production targets are likely to be met giving Tesla a huge boost in top-line revenue and inches them closer towards that exponential growth they've been promising.

If you're in the manufacturing industry or are familiar with the production battery lines I'd love to hear from you. Please shoot me a note from our contact page.
