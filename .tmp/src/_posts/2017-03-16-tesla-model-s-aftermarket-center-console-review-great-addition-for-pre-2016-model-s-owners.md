Since joining the Tesla family in January of 2016, I&#8217;ve wondered how some of the aftermarket products fit. This is my first review of such a product, the EVAnnex.com center console.

EVAnnex was one of the first companies to start making aftermarket upgrades for Tesla cars. They have a great blog and even a couple books. If you&#8217;re a Tesla Model S or X owner, I think you&#8217;d like what you find on their site. The family that runs the business are actual Tesla owners and fans. They are honest and helpful (in my experience) when you have questions. I highly recommend checking them out, and no, I wasn&#8217;t paid to say that.
