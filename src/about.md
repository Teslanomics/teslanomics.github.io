Teslanomics is a community of Tesla enthusiasts thatÂ seek to understand the true impact of Tesla products and programs by analyzing the data and seeing what it shows.

## How did Teslanomics start?

_From the founder, Ben Sullins_

I've been a data scientist since the late 90's mostly focused on helping companies make the most of their data. While I've been working in corporate America for almost 20 years, when my son was born in July of 2015 I knew that the long hours and stress were going to make it hard to be a good father, something I didn't have growing up. And like all parents, I wanted to give my new son what I didn't have.

Soon after he was born, I started to look for other avenues to generate income that gave me more flexibility in my schedule so I could spend more time with him. I had already been producing data science training videos on Pluralsight.com and Lynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning), so I had some residual income built up. In April of 2016, I took the leap and decided to quit my full-time job as a Chief Data Officer at Pluralsight.com and dedicate all my time to authoring online courses and doing YouTube.

This was a scary moment.

As I started making more online content, I honed in on YouTube as it seemed to be a great avenue to build an audience and thus a sustainable business. This is how I ended up using my data science skills on Tesla data.

I started my Tesla journey in Jan of last year when I bought a used Model S. Almost a year later my wife asked me how much money we had saved over the past year. So I put my data geek hat on and did some analysis. As it turned out, we pay a ton for electricity here in SoCal, so it ended up only being about 40% cheaper which for us is about $30/mo.

This video landed well on YouTube getting over 500K views in less than two months. Since then I've realized that the Tesla community is a passionate group of intelligent people that love the detailed analysis of the facts behind the company and their products.

This is why I decided to start the YouTube channel and associated site. To apply my skills in the field of Data Science to a company I admire, and to share this knowledge with a passionate group of likeminded individuals.
