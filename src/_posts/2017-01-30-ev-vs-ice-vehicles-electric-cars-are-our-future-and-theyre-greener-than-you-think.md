Some rumors have been spreading online that gas powered cars, or ICE vehicles, are better for the environment than Electric Vehicles (EVs). In this video, I break down the data behind this comparison and help us understand the difference.

## Our EV Future

First I start by looking into the predictions that we’ll all be driving Electric Vehicles by 2040. Some estimates report that up to 40% of automobiles by then will be electric. This is primarily due to increased range of vehicles and the continually dropping price. There are some assumptions here, however:

1 &#8211; Tax Subsidies Continue

This assumption is on pretty shaky ground in the United States with the new Trump Administration, but who knows what he will do. In many other parts of the world, the subsidies appear to be more stable. If all of the subsidies were canceled, however, it would merely delay the EV revolution until the batteries become substantially cheaper.

2 &#8211; Charging Infrastructure

Without a reliable charging network, the EV future won’t occur. That said, there are now over 100,000 charging locations in the United States and near that many in the EU. In the developing world, this will be difficult as the big infrastructure projects will take years to develop. All signs point to an EV future around the globe.

## CO2 Emissions Comparison

The usual arguments that ICE cars are greener than EVs centers around 2 points:

1 &#8211; EVs create more CO2 to manufacture

This is true. The batteries needed do indeed create more CO2 emissions than ICE vehicles.

2 &#8211; You’re just switching the CO2 from the tailpipe to the power plant

This is also true, but, it is part of the reason why EVs are better for the environment. The big reason is that in many areas of the country the electric grid is clean already, and produces little CO2. Also, as the electrical grid continues to switch to renewables as they become the cheaper option, all EVs will continue to reduce the CO2 emitted.

The cherry on top here is that nearly 32% of EV owners fuel their cars using their solar panels. In this case, the CO2 generated by the EV after it’s been manufactured and delivered is negligible. In comparison, the ICE car will not magically become more fuel efficient over time.

I’d love to hear from you…do you have an EV? Are you looking to buy one soon? What sort of incentives to buy an EV exists in your location?
