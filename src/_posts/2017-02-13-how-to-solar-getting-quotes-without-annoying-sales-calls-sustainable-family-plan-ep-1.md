Getting solar quotes without being bombarded by sales calls is rare. I was lucky enough to have some friends in the industry that steered me to a website that will get you quotes without sharing your contact information.</p>

**<a href="http://teslanomics.co/EnergySage" target="_blank">Get quotes at http://teslanomics.co/EnergySage</a>**

In the process of choosing a solar provider I learned a lot and in this video I walk you through everything you need to know as well as how to use EnergySage.com to compare the quotes.

EnergySage has agreed to help our community decide on solar here by answering your questions below. If you use our link above and have any questions you can leave them below and they&#8217;ll monitor this video, responding to your questions for a limited time.

Each week I share videos like this breaking down the economics behind Tesla and related industries like Solar, Electric Vehicles, Home Batteries, and Tunnels (I guess?)

I love all the feedback and regularly check the comments here so if you want to send me a message go ahead below, or you can join me on the other social sites below
