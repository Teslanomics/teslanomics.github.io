Traveling in a Tesla Model S from San Diego to Santa Barbara through the Tesla Supercharger network can be tricky considering LA Traffic and ghost Supercharger stops. In this video I break down the route I like to take and what Tesla Superchargers are best for coffee and food as well as how to deal with LA traffic.

## What is a Tesla?

Tesla Motors (often shortened to Tesla) is an American automaker and energy storage company co-founded by Elon Musk, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, JB Straubel and Ian Wright, and is based in Palo Alto, California. The company specializes in electric cars and their powertrain components and also produces battery charging equipment.\[7\]\[8\][9]

Tesla first gained widespread attention following its production of the Tesla Roadster, the first electric sports car, in 2008.\[10] The company&#8217;s second vehicle, the Model S, an electric luxury sedan, debuted in 2012. In Q1 2013, Tesla released its stock profits for the first time from its NASDAQ ticker symbol.[11\]\[12\] Global sales for the Model S passed the 100,000 units milestone in December 2015, three and a half years after its introduction,\[13] and it was the world&#8217;s best-selling plug-in vehicle that year.[14] As of June 2016, the Model S ranked as the world&#8217;s all-time second-best-selling plug-in after the Nissan Leaf.[15] The car was then followed by the Model X, a crossover SUV. Tesla&#8217;s next vehicle is the Model 3,[16] which was unveiled in March 2016 and is slated for release in 2017 with a price at US$35,000 before any government incentives.[17\]\[18\]

As of September 2016, Tesla Motors has sold almost 164,000 electric cars worldwide since delivery of its first Tesla Roadster in 2008, making the electric carmaker the second largest global plug-in car manufacturer after the Renault-Nissan Alliance.\[19] Musk, the CEO, has said that he envisions Tesla Motors as an independent automaker,[20] aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer.[21\]\[22\]

Tesla manufactures equipment for home and office battery charging, and has installed a network of high-powered Superchargers across North America, Europe and Asia.[23] The company also operates a Destination Charging program, under which shops, restaurants and other venues are offered fast chargers for their customers.[24]
