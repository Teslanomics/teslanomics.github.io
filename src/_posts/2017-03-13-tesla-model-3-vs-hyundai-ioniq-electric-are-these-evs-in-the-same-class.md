The **Tesla Model 3** is yet to be released, or even the configuration options announced, yet other car manufacturers are dying to beat them to the punch with an affordable EV. Hyundai is brand new to the hybrid, plugin-hybrid, and EV market and they&#8217;re starting out with a novel approach.

Hyundai will release the Ioniq in three forms (eventually), a hybrid version, plugin-hybrid, and fully electric model. The hybrid is available today and is a decent competitor to the Toyota Prius if you&#8217;re willing to take a chance on a new entrant into the market.

Hyundai currently states on their website that the plugin-hybrid (PHEV) will be available for sale in the fall of 2017. However, the electric version has been delayed already, so it&#8217;s a bit uncertain at the moment.

The EV version of the Ioniq is arguably the best &#8220;city-EV&#8221; on the market but in my opinion, still falls into the first generation class of electric vehicles. With only 124mi range (estimated) and 120hp, it won&#8217;t eliminate your range anxiety nor give you that &#8220;Tesla Smile&#8221; from the snappy acceleration.

Overall I think this is a decent first attempt by Hyundai to enter the EV market and I am hopeful that the market is continuing to grow. Perhaps their next version will be up to par with the newer 200+mi EVs hitting the market in 2017 and 2018.
